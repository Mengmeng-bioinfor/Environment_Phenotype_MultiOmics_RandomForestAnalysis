# Environment_Phenotype_MultiOmics_RandomForestAnalysis
Used to build a project about Environment–Phenotype–Multi-Omics Random Forest Analysis. This repository can be used to integrate environmental factors, phenotypic data and multi-omics features (such as gene expression, metabolites, microbiome, etc.), and use random forest methods for association analysis and predictive modeling.

# 🌿 Environment–Phenotype–Multi-Omics Random Forest Analysis

This project aims to integrate **environmental factors**, **phenotypic traits**, and **multi-omics data** to identify key predictors using **Random Forest** models. The workflow supports biomarker discovery, feature selection, and predictive modeling in systems biology, ecology, or agricultural studies.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Combine environmental, phenotypic, and multi-omics features into a unified analytical framework.
- Use Random Forest (RF) for feature importance ranking.
- Visualize and interpret relationships between environment and phenotypic responses.
- Support multi-level omics: transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, etc.

---

## 🧬 Data Structure

### 🔹 Inputs

- `env_data.csv`: Environmental metadata (e.g., temperature, depth, nutrients)
- `phenotype.csv`: Phenotypic observations (e.g., body weight, survival rate)
- `omics_*.csv`: Omics features (e.g., `omics_gene.csv`, `omics_microbiome.csv`, etc.)

All input files should share a common `SampleID`.

## ⚙️ Main Features

- Data integration and cleaning
- Train-test split or cross-validation
- Random Forest regression/classification
- Feature importance ranking
- Heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlation matrices
- Optional recursive feature elimination (RFE)

## 📊 Example Workflow

```python
# 1. Load environment, phenotype, and omics datasets
# 2. Merge them by SampleID
# 3. Fit RandomForest model
# 4. Output top features and SHAP values
