# Environment_Phenotype_MultiOmics_RandomForestAnalysis
Used to build a project about Environment–Phenotype–Multi-Omics Random Forest Analysis. This repository can be used to integrate environmental factors, phenotypic data and multi-omics features (such as gene expression, metabolites, microbiome, etc.), and use random forest methods for association analysis and predictive modeling.
